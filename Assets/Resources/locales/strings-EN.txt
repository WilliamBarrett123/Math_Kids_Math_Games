  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage2Title" ScaleFactor="1">WHY GIVING BACK IS IMPORTANT?</string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage3Title" ScaleFactor="1">HOW DO WE KEEP OUR KIDS' APPS FREE?</string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage1Txt1" ScaleFactor="1">Take a moment to look at your children and think
about where you want them to be in 10, 20 or 30
years. What opportunities do you want them to have
in life? A good education? A position from where they
can make a positive difference for their families and
community? </string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage1Txt2" ScaleFactor="1">Our children are our future, and they deserve the best
opportunities we as parents and communities can
give them. But not all parents have the time or ability
to help their children with their homework. And most
of us, as parents, can probably recognize the wish for
our kids to receive a better education than we had. </string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage1Txt3" ScaleFactor="1">When I became a parent, I knew I would do everything to
give my daughter the best education and the best
opportunities as she grows up. But at the same time,
I felt it was unfair that tens of millions of kids all over the
world, would not get the same opportunity for even a basic
education or learning to read and write.</string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage1Txt4" ScaleFactor="1">That’s why I decided to launch the educational apps
branch of     <![CDATA[<b>RV AppStudios</b>]]> to help children get an early

  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage2Txt2" ScaleFactor="1">Mobile devices and internet connection is becoming
available in all corners of the world.
That is our opportunity as app developers to reach
and make a positive difference for children
who do not have access to schools or books,
but whose parents have a smartphone. </string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage2Txt3" ScaleFactor="1">Our apps are developed to give preschoolers from all
corners of the world an educational advantage,
but especially to teach those kids who otherwise
don’t have the opportunity to get a basic education.</string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage2Txt4" ScaleFactor="1">Because getting an early start learning universal skills cre-
ates better opportunities for children everywhere! </string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage3Txt1" ScaleFactor="1">My team and I have been blessed to be able to make a
living doing what we love - developing gaming apps
(for adults). Now we want to give back to children
around the world by investing our company profits
into creating some of the most popular apps for
toddlers and children eager to have fun and learn.</string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage3Txt1-1" ScaleFactor="1">- We simply find making a difference much more
rewarding than getting rich ourselves.</string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage3Txt2" ScaleFactor="1">We believe that kids shouldn't be influenced by ads or
in-app promotions. That’s why we keep our kids’
applications     <![CDATA[<b>100% AD FREE</b>]]> and with     <![CDATA[<b>No in-app</b>]]><![CDATA[<b>purchases.</b>]]> The only way we can make preschool

how much their children have developed using our apps

getting a head start through pre-school learning apps,
becomes the future leaders of change in their

  <string name="txtOurStorySettings">     Over <![CDATA[<color=#ff0018>30,000,000</color>]]> kids use our educational apps every month, we have become one of the world's largest developers of Children's Educational Apps. And we continue to do it completely for <![CDATA[<color=#ff0018>FREE</color>]]>.

      Why? — When I became a parent, I knew I would do everything to give my daughter the best education and the best opportunities as she grows up. I believe many parents recognize the longing to give their kids more opportunities or better education than they had themselves.

      But not all parents have the time or ability to help their children with their homework. And as much as I wanted the best for my own daughter, I felt it was unfair that tens of millions of kids all over the world would not get the same opportunity for even basic education or learn to read and write.

      I realized that as an app developer, I had an opportunity to do something about it. — Not for profit, but to give children from all corners of the world an early start (in) learning essential skills like counting, spelling, and math in an entertaining way.

      So I launched the children's educational app branch of RV AppStudios with the purpose to produce FREE apps helping children develop their creativity, memory, and logical thinking by playing games.

      To achieve that, we needed to keep the apps and games safe for the kids. So I decided to invest the profits from our other app development business to make 100% FREE kids' applications with NO ADS and NO in-app purchases. — The only ones who should benefit from these apps are the children.

      Our passion is to see the children getting a head start through pre-school learning apps, becoming the future leaders of change in their communities. And we finance our passion ourselves to make it happen!</string>

  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage2All" ScaleFactor="1">     Take a moment to look at your children and think about where you want them to be in 10, 20 or 30 years. What opportunities do you want them to have in life? A good education? A position from where they can make a positive difference for their families and community?

      Our children are our future, and they deserve the best opportunities we as parents and communities can give them. But not all parents have the time or ability to help their children with their homework. And most of us, as parents, can probably recognize the wish for our kids to receive a better education than we had.

      When I became a parent, I knew I would do everything to give my daughter the best education and the best opportunities as she grows up. But at the same time, I felt it was unfair that tens of millions of kids all over the world, would not get the same opportunity for even a basic education or learning to read and write.

      That’s why I decided to launch the educational apps branch of RV AppStudios to help children get an early start learning essential skills like counting, spelling, and math,And giving those apps away for FREE!</string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage3All" ScaleFactor="1">     Children are meant to learn by playing games and having fun! So we develop entertaining FREE kids’ apps that lets children develop their creativity and test their intelligence with fun jigsaw puzzles, challenging memory games, and much more.

      Mobile devices and internet connection is becoming available in all corners of the world. That is our opportunity as app developers to reach and make a positive difference for children who do not have access to schools or books, but whose parents have a smartphone.

      Our apps are developed to give preschoolers from all corners of the world an educational advantage, but especially to teach those kids who otherwise don’t have the opportunity to get a basic education.

      Because getting an early start learning universal skills creates better opportunities for children everywhere!</string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage4All" ScaleFactor="1">     My team and I have been blessed to be able to make a living doing what we love - developing gaming apps (for adults). Now we want to give back to children around the world by investing our company profits into creating some of the most popular apps for toddlers and children eager to have fun and learn.

      We simply find making a difference much more rewarding than getting rich ourselves.

      We believe that kids shouldn't be influenced by ads or in-app promotions. That’s why we keep our kids’ applications 100% AD FREE and with NO IN-APP PURCHASES. The only way we can make preschool learning apps available to all children, is by keeping it 100% free to use.

      Every time we read reviews from happy parents, telling us how much their children have developed using our apps and playing our games, it shows us that our tiny contribution to our local and global society are worth it!

      We hope our efforts can inspire others to give back and make a difference. Especially that the children getting a head start through pre-school learning apps, becomes the future leaders of change in their communities.</string>
