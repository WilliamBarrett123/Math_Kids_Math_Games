  <string name="txtOurStorySettings">  બાળકોની મફત એિꀣલકેશꀢસમાંથી અમારી ગેꀧસના 14 િમિલયન માિસક ડાઉનલોꀕસ સાથે, અમે બાળકોની શૈꀁિણક એિꀣલકેશꀢસના િવꈂના સૌથી મોટા િવકાસકતાꄔઓમાંના એક બની ગયા છીએ. અને અમે તેને સંપૂણꄔપણે મફતમાં કરવાનું ચાલુ રાખીએ છીએ.

   "કેમ?" -ꀐયારે હું િપતા બꀢયો, ꀘયારે મને ખબર હતી કે મારી દીકરી જેમ મોટી થશે તેમ તેને ꁰેꀴઠ િશꀁણ અને ꁰેꀴઠ તકો આપવા માટે હું બધું જ કરીશ. હું માનું છું કે ઘણા માતા-િપતા તેમના બાળકોને તેમના કરતાં વધુ સારી તકો અથવા વધુ સારું િશꀁણ આપવાની ઝંખનાને રાખે છે.

   પરંતુ તમામ માતા-િપતા પાસે તેમના બાળકોને તેમના ગૃહકાયꄔમાં મદદ કરવા માટે સમય કે ꀁમતા હોતી નથી. અને હું મારી પોતાની પુꁕી માટે ꁰેꀴઠ ઇꀈછતો હતો, મને લાꀅયું કે સમꁂ િવꈂમાં લાખો બાળકોને મૂળભૂત િશꀁણ માટે સમાન તક ન મળે અથવા વાંચતા અને લખતા ન શીખે તે અયોꀅય છે.

    મને સમꈐયું કે એક એિꀣલકેશન ડેવલપર તરીકે, મને તેના િવશે કંઈક કરવાની તક મળી છે. -"નફા માટે નહીં", પરંતુ િવꈂના દરેક ખૂણેથી બાળકોને વહેલી તકે ગણવા, જોડણી અને ગિણત જેવી આવꀳયક કૌશꀰયો મનોરંજક રીતે શીખવાનું શꄖ કરવા માટે.

    તેથી મેં બાળકોને રમતો રમીને તેમની સજꄔનાꀘમકતા, યાદશિꀃત અને તાિકꄔક િવચારસરણી િવકસાવવામાં મદદ કરતી મફત એિꀣલકેશꀢસ બનાવવાના હેતુથી "RV Aappstudios" ની બાળકોની શૈꀁિણક એિꀣલકેશન શાખા શꄖ કરી.

   તે હાંસલ કરવા માટે, અમારે બાળકો માટે એꀣસ અને ગેꀧસને સુરિꀁત રાખવાની જꄖર હતી.  તેથી મેં બાળકોની એિꀣલકેશꀢસ બનાવવા માટે અમારા અꀢય એપ ડેવલપમેꀢટ િબઝનેસમાંથી નફામાં રોકાણ કરવાનું નꀃકી કયꄔું "કોઈ ꈐહેરાતો નિહ" અને "એપમાં ખરીદી નિહ" સાથે "100% મફત". -આ એꀣસનો લાભ ફꀃત બાળકોને જ મળવો જોઈએ.

   અમારો જુꀵસો એ છે કે બાળકોને ꁠી-ꀵકૂલ લિનꄔંગ એꀣસ ꄕારા શꄖઆત કરતા જોવાનું, તેમના સમુદાયોમાં પિરવતꄔનના ભાિવ નેતાઓ બનાવવાનું. અને તે થાય તે માટે અમે અમારા જુꀵસાને ફાઇનાꀢસ કરીએ છીએ!</string>

  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage2Title" ScaleFactor="1">Why Giving Back Is Important?</string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage3Title" ScaleFactor="1">How do we keep our kids' apps free?</string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage1Txt1" ScaleFactor="1">Take a moment to look at your children and think
about where you want them to be in 10, 20 or 30
years. What opportunities do you want them to have
in life? A good education? A position from where they
can make a positive difference for their families and
community? </string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage1Txt2" ScaleFactor="1">Our children are our future, and they deserve the best
opportunities we as parents and communities can
give them. But not all parents have the time or ability
to help their children with their homework. And most
of us, as parents, can probably recognize the wish for
our kids to receive a better education than we had. </string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage1Txt3" ScaleFactor="1">When I became a parent, I knew I would do everything to
give my daughter the best education and the best
opportunities as she grows up. But at the same time,
I felt it was unfair that tens of millions of kids all over the
world, would not get the same opportunity for even a basic
education or learning to read and write.</string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage1Txt4" ScaleFactor="1">That’s why I decided to launch the educational apps
branch of     &lt;b&gt;RV AppStudios&lt;/b&gt; to help children get an early
start learning essential skills like counting, spelling,
and math… And giving those apps away for     &lt;b&gt;FREE!&lt;/b&gt;</string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage1Txt5" ScaleFactor="1">- Founder of RV AppStudios</string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage2Txt1" ScaleFactor="1">Children are meant to learn by playing games and
having fun! So we develop entertaining     &lt;b&gt;FREE&lt;/b&gt; kids’
apps that lets children develop their creativity and test
their intelligence with fun jigsaw puzzles, challenging
memory games, and much more.</string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage2Txt2" ScaleFactor="1">Mobile devices and internet connection is becoming
available in all corners of the world.
That is our opportunity as app developers to reach
and make a positive difference for children
who do not have access to schools or books,
but whose parents have a smartphone. </string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage2Txt3" ScaleFactor="1">Our apps are developed to give preschoolers from all
corners of the world an educational advantage,
but especially to teach those kids who otherwise
don’t have the opportunity to get a basic education.</string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage2Txt4" ScaleFactor="1">Because getting an early start learning universal skills cre-
ates better opportunities for children everywhere! </string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage3Txt1" ScaleFactor="1">My team and I have been blessed to be able to make a
living doing what we love - developing gaming apps
(for adults). Now we want to give back to children
around the world by investing our company profits
into creating some of the most popular apps for
toddlers and children eager to have fun and learn.</string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage3Txt1-1" ScaleFactor="1">- We simply find making a difference much more
rewarding than getting rich ourselves.</string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage3Txt2" ScaleFactor="1">We believe that kids shouldn't be influenced by ads or
in-app promotions. That’s why we keep our kids’
applications     &lt;b&gt;100% AD FREE&lt;/b&gt; and with     &lt;b&gt;No in-app&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;purchases.&lt;/b&gt; The only way we can make preschool
learning apps available to all children, is by keeping it
100% free to use.</string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage3Txt3" ScaleFactor="1">Every time we read reviews from happy parents, telling us
how much their children have developed using our apps
and playing our games, it shows us that our tiny
contribution to our local and global society are worth it!</string>
  <string name="txtWhyItsFreeBannerPage3Txt4" ScaleFactor="1">We hope our efforts can inspire others to give back
and make a difference. Especially that the children
getting a head start through pre-school learning apps,
becomes the future leaders of change in their
communities.</string>

our mobile games and Free Kids’ Apps.     &lt;b&gt;- Currently&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; that’s over 15 million downloads every month!&lt;/b&gt; More than
two-thirds (12 million) of those downloads come from
parents wanting to help their kids begin learning from
an early age, effectively reducing the risk of falling
behind as they start in school. It’s these millions of
children around the world getting a chance for a better
future that fuels our passion to continue!</string>
